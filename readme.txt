this is the readme.txt for multiloquent theme v6

this theme has 10 widget areas:
1) [not used]
2) in advert snippet, included on posts if device is a mobile device
3) in advert snippet, included on posts if device is not mobile device -you can use text widgets, or a more advanced advert plugin and place widgets to suit
4) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]
5) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]
6) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]
7) in sidebar.php [so it goes under the content, but above the footer]
8) used in social.php [suggested that you put a text widget in it and add in your social links - to add a second lot, eg for your rss feed / facebook page]
9) [not used]
10) footer - just above the footer menu for you to add whatever you want

it also has two menus:

header menu:
this menu is shown in the top nav bar and is a bootstrap dropdown style menu


footer menu
this menu is shown in the footer and is a bootstrap button group 



tags:
these are bootstrap 'label' style buttons and will have different colours based on the total number of times the tag has been used across all posts / pages on your site


other things:

the main slider on the homepage will use your top ten posts if you have the top10 plugin installed, otherwise it will use your 10 most recent as a fallback

it gets the image from the 'featured image' against the post if it exists, if it doesnt then it uses a default image


has a theme for TW Recent Posts Widget 'yarpp' - yet another related posts plugin and it will auto include the related posts in the post page if its installed
[I suggest that you pick multiples of 3 for the number of related posts to show - 3 will be one row, 6 will be two rows]

has support for jetpack sharing plugins [and puts them in the correct position in your post if you have it installed]

moves as much js to the footer as possible without breaking wordpress for faster page loads
